1. Compressing then encrypting would hide more patterns than doing it
the other way around. if you encrypt it using all the information then the
result would have traces of this included information. Since the compression
will have less information the resulting encryption would not show as much

2.
a)size is 293 bytes before gpg
b)size is 710 bytes 
c)yes since i got a smaller file

3.I believe it would work better since the amount of bytes would not be 
increased and would remain constant

4. it would compress the same because the amount of bytes would stay the same

5.The shannon entropy would be the same since the size of the file does not 
change so the average length would be the same
